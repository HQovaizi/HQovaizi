### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
- ðŸ”­ As a technical developer consultant, I aim to better elevate the abilities and quality of the strategies and architecture for business clients.

I've largely dedicated my efforts in managing several AI research groups in addition to teaching Graduate Students a broad range of Computer Science topics involving: Networks, Web Development, Machine Learning, and Dynamic Programming at [Ryerson University](https://www.ryerson.ca/graduate/programs/computer-science/).
